For a memory-efficient backend to handle sockets for your Tic-Tac-Toe game, I would recommend using Node.js with Socket.IO. This combination is well-suited for real-time applications and is known for its performance and scalability. Here's why this choice is good for your use case:

1. Node.js:
   - Non-blocking, event-driven architecture
   - Excellent for handling multiple concurrent connections
   - Low memory footprint
   - Fast execution
   - Large ecosystem of packages

2. Socket.IO:
   - Built on top of WebSockets
   - Provides fallbacks for older browsers
   - Easy to implement real-time, bi-directional communication
   - Supports room functionality for managing multiple game sessions
   - Automatic reconnection

Here's a basic outline of how you can structure your backend:

1. Set up a Node.js project:
   ```
   mkdir tictactoe-backend
   cd tictactoe-backend
   npm init -y
   npm install express socket.io
   ```

2. Create a basic server (server.js):
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const http = require('http');
   const socketIo = require('socket.io');

   const app = express();
   const server = http.createServer(app);
   const io = socketIo(server, {
     cors: {
       origin: "http://localhost:3000",  // Your React app's URL
       methods: ["GET", "POST"]
     }
   });

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

   server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

   // Socket.IO logic will go here
   ```

3. Implement game logic and socket events:
   ```javascript
   const games = {};

   io.on('connection', (socket) => {
     console.log('New client connected');

     socket.on('joinGame', (gameId) => {
       // Join a game room
       socket.join(gameId);
       if (!games[gameId]) {
         games[gameId] = {
           board: Array(9).fill(null),
           players: [socket.id],
           currentPlayer: 0
         };
       } else if (games[gameId].players.length < 2) {
         games[gameId].players.push(socket.id);
         io.to(gameId).emit('gameStart', games[gameId]);
       }
     });

     socket.on('makeMove', ({ gameId, index }) => {
       const game = games[gameId];
       if (game && game.players[game.currentPlayer] === socket.id) {
         game.board[index] = game.currentPlayer === 0 ? 'X' : 'O';
         game.currentPlayer = 1 - game.currentPlayer;
         io.to(gameId).emit('updateGame', game);
         
         // Check for win or draw
         // Implement win/draw logic here
       }
     });

     socket.on('disconnect', () => {
       console.log('Client disconnected');
       // Handle player disconnection
     });
   });
   ```

4. In your React app, use a Socket.IO client to connect to the backend:
   ```javascript
   import io from 'socket.io-client';

   const socket = io('http://localhost:5000');

   // Use socket.emit() to send events and socket.on() to listen for events
   ```

This setup provides a solid foundation for your multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's memory-efficient and can handle multiple game sessions simultaneously. You can further optimize by implementing features like:

- Cleaning up inactive game sessions
- Implementing a matchmaking system
- Adding authentication
- Scaling horizontally with multiple Node.js instances and a message broker like Redis

## Requirements
- Only two players can play the game at a time.
- Can message each other while playing.
- needs to have link to play with each other.
- a player should be able to generate and send a link to the other player.
- a player should be able to see the status of the other player.
- clean up the group or resources after the game is over.
